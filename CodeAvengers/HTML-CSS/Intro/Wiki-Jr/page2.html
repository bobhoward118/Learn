<h1>Neo</h1>

Trinity contacts him, saying that a man named Morpheus can explain its meaning.</p>
<p>The Agents, led by Agent Smith, apprehend Neo at his office. Undeterred, Neo meets Morpheus, who tells him he can learn the truth about reality by choosing to swallow a red pill, or he can take a blue pill and return to his old life with no memory of the Matrix.</p>
