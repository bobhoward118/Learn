The DNS records are created inside of a Hosted Zone in Route 53. A Hosted Zone is essentially a group of DNS records for a single domain.
Access Route 53 (at AWS) => Hosted Zones => open it
Note all 4 NS (Name Server) entries, click on Registered domains under Domains, note Name Servers (same as in Hosted Zones)
An 'A' record directs a domain name to an IP address
Under Hosted Zone, choose Create Record Set
Leave Name field blank
Set Type to "A - IPv4 address"
Leave TTL(Seconds) at default 300
In Value text box enter GitHub's IP Addresses (DNS servers):
192.30.252.153
192.30.252.154
Setup www Sub-Domain using a CNAME record (Canonical Name) which specifies that a domain name will be used as an alias, or substitute, for the true (canonical) domain name
Create Record Set, in Name field enter only www, set Type to CNAME - Canonical name, in Value box enter username.github.io, save record set.
REVIEW:
NS (Name Server) record translates domain name into IP
A (Alias) record directs domain to GitHub's servers using their IP addresses
CNAME (canonical name) record specifies what customer domain will point to true (canonical) domain
* can also use dig command in terminal to look up domain name to ensure CNAME and A records were set correctly
