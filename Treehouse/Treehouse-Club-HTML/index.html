	<h1>Learn To Code</h1>
	<h2>By Bob Howard</h2>

	<p>This is a story of learning to code web pages.</p>   
	<p>I joined Team Treehouse and immediately began creating web pages.</p>
	<p>I then uploaded the files and stood back to enjoy the created work.</p>
	<p>Gradually, I learned how to implement many features and style content like a pro.</p>
